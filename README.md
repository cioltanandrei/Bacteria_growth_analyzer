Regression:

Regression is a statistical approach used to model the connection between one or more independent variables and a dependent variable. It seeks to identify a mathematical equation that best fits the data and may be used to forecast the values of the dependent variable based on the independent variables.

Linear regression:

Linear regression is a type of regression analysis in which the relationship between the dependent and independent variables is assumed to be straight. It's looking for a linear equation that explains the relationship between the variables.

Linear regression is a prominent tool for forecasting outcomes, comprehending variable correlations, and estimating the amount and direction of such interactions.
